We focus on developing resilient, high-yield fruit crops and practical tools that help growers thrive in changing climates and competitive markets. Our work blends modern breeding, data analytics, and on-farm advisory so producers can plant with confidence and harvest with consistency.</p> <p>Our core portfolio centers on berries—strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry—and avocado. By concentrating on these species, we go deep on the traits that matter most: earliness for better market timing, firmness and shelf life for logistics, flavor that earns repeat purchases, and stress tolerance that protects yield. Every variety we advance is measured against real production constraints like labor efficiency, water availability, and disease pressure.</p> <p>Research is the engine of Agrodova. We run multi-site trials across Spain and partner regions to test genetics under diverse soils, climates, and cultivation systems (conventional, soilless, organic). Using rigorous protocols, sensor data, and statistical analysis, we identify lines that deliver stable performance year after year—not just in controlled environments, but on commercial farms where conditions are complex and unpredictable.</p> <p>Sustainability is designed into our approach, not bolted on. We prioritize water-smart agronomy, selecting genetics that maintain productivity with lower irrigation demand and providing precision-irrigation guidance that aligns with local resources. Integrated pest management, soil-health practices, and nutrient-use efficiency are built into our recommendations so growers can reduce inputs without sacrificing quality or volume.</p> <p>Quality and biosecurity sit at the heart of our nursery operations. From mother-plant management and pathogen screening to traceability and phytosanitary controls, we safeguard plant vigor from propagation through delivery. Post-harvest, our guidance helps producers maintain fruit integrity across the cold chain, reducing waste, protecting margins, and meeting retailer specifications with confidence.</p> <p>Beyond plants, Agrodova is a service partner. We offer technical training, crop monitoring, and rapid problem-solving support throughout the season. Our advisory teams help optimize planting density, substrate selection, fertigation programs, and canopy management—translating research into practical, step-by-step actions that improve outcomes in the field and at market.</p></div>
